dpush - a wrapper to `drive <https://github.com/odeke-em/drive>`_
===============================================================================
I want ``drive`` to

* Send Telegram notification after ``push`` finished
* Remap ``delete`` to ``trash`` so I won't accidentally destroy files
* Queue my ``push`` commands and do it one-by-one

None of those should be made into ``drive``, so here the wrapper comes!

Work in progress
